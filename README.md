# Portfolio Site

#### Visit https://jennyle.io

###### I wouldn't of have been able to make this site without ReactJS, GatsbyJS, styled-components, reactstrap, react-headroom, react-reveal, typefaces, and the emotional support from my friends & family! :P

## General Info
This is my portfolio site that showcases my projects and also has some information about me.

## Setup
Run these commands in the cloned repository folder:
```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install
gatsby develop
```
Now it should be hosted on `localhost:8000`
