#### Challenge
Create an interface that reimagines how people interact with immersive 360-degree video, 
using a mobile phone and Google Cardboard. Students can create their own 360 video for this project; 
360 cameras are available for loan, upon request.

#### Problem Statement
For this project, I wanted to tackle the difficulty of following instructions. The process can evoke stress, anxiety, and confusion. Because of these complicated emotions, I wanted to alleviate them in some way so that the user would be less stressed. 
I decided to specifically do an IKEA Furniture Simulator because many people can relate to how vague/hard the instructions can be 
while building their furniture. I wanted to create a simulation where the user would go through an emotional downfall full of confusion 
to only be brought up by a calming experience with helpful assistance.

#### Low-Fi Prototyping - Sketches
##### Initial
These are some sketches that I did for brainstorming what I could do for this assignment:

1. **Cooking Simulator** - Derived from the game Overcooked. I wanted to create a simulator that would those who want to learn how to cook. You would use a Joy-Con or Wii controller as utensils. The user would learn many recipes without having to be in the kitchen! 

2. **Underwater Simulator** - This would be an educational simulator for those who are scared of swimming underwater or want to see some animals that live underwater. Hovering over different animals will bring up facts and information about them so that the user can learn more. 

3. **Party Simulator** - This is for people who have anxiety when it comes to socializing. A party simulator would give them some sort of experience when it comes to going to a party and socializing with them. This will help them soothe their anxiety and calm them down, showing them that it isn't that bad. 

4. **Mall Directory** - This is for people who get lost easily or have a hard time finding a store on a mall directory. They will simulate the path to the store such that they will receive encouraging messages as they journey to the store. From there, they will hopefully take that experience with them in real life so they can shop efficiently!

5. **Car Simulator** - This is for car dealerships and future car owners. If a dealership doesn't have a car in stock, the customer can still check it out in VR as if they are sitting in the driver seat of the car. It can also help them get use to the car controls and where everything else is to see if they like it before buying. 

6. **Parkour Simulator** - This is for individuals who want to experience parkour! It can be anyone, as long as they don't get motion sickness as this would be an intense VR simulator. The user would experience jumping over rooftops and falling from high places. ... Scary! 

7. **Date Simulator** - For those who get anxiety and nervous it comes to the first date. This will help the user go through a sequence of dialogue such that it will keep them thinking quick on their feet in tough situations. Enjoy some pretend pasta and fancy mood lighting as well! 

8. **Showroom Simulator** - This is for future new home owners and realtors. If someone wants to see a house in another province or country, then they will be able to view it through VR. They would be able to walk through the rooms, experience the environment and check out appliances to help them make their search faster! 

9. **What Should I Wear?!** - As a lover of clothes, I wanted to create a clothing simulator which would allow me to upload a photo of myself to try on different outfits without heading into a fitting room. From there, I would be able to see where each article of clothing is from to go buy it in real life! 

10. **360* Of A Dog's Life** - Wouldn't it be cool to experience what our furry friends see from their point of view? This simulator allows the user to see what they see and actually simulate what it's like to be a pet! 

11. **IKEA Desk Builder** - Stress, anxiety and confusion can show when given vague instructions without any words. This simulator will help the user build their desk without any stress and heavy movements. All they need to do is take in the experience, information, and just go with it! 

12. **Makeup Simulator** - As a huge fan of makeup, I would like a simulator that allows me to try on different products on an image of myself to see what works for me and what doesn't. There would also be different tools to use which would help me see what I would like to buy! This simulator can also save favourite looks to see again for review. From the critique done in class, the Party Simulator, Mall Directory Simulator and IKEA Desk Builder were selected to ideate some more.

##### Variation Sketches
Some variations of the Party Simulator, Mall Directory Simulator, and IKEA Furniture Simulator that came out of the brainstorming phase:

###### Party Simulator Variation Sketches

1. **Converse With Others** - The whole simulator is based off of socializing. Having a conversation with others will teach the user how to think quick on their feet and how to give polite answers rather than just being mean. 

2. **Playing Games** - Participating in games such as video or board games is a great way to create friendships and bond with other people. As long as you're having fun, then that's great! 

3. **Eating Food** - While eating food, many people like to talk to others. There are so many topics to talk about. And since your mouth is full while eating, this is a great way to learn how to do head gestures to respond. 

4. **Verbal Response** - Rather than clicking on options to respond or doing head gestures, there will also be a mic to record and recognize your voice to respond to questions and to talk with others. 

5. **Throw Up Situation** - When a party is extremely rowdy, there is bound to be someone who throws up. The user needs to know how to think quick when this situation occurs, and how to deal with it. 

6. **Play With Dog** - When there is a dog in the house, a lot of people will play with the dog. The user will be able to pet it and play with it via toys. Additionally, the dog can get angry at them too. 

7. **Random Approaches** - At random times, you will be approached or receive a notification stating that a group needs one more person to start a game or for a talk. That is your que to either accept or decline the offer. If you decline it then you will receive a penalty of some sort. 

8. **Choosing Music** - Music always makes the party more lively. Depending on the song you choose, you will receive different reactions which could make you more likeable or the other way around. 

9. **Attract Others** - The user will receive an option to attract others, which will then draw attention to themselves. They will have to do an action loud enough to draw the attention of others, to potentially start a group. 

###### Mall Directory Variation Sketches

1. **Search Up Stores + Add To Queue** - The user will be able to browse through the directory and add them to a list to go through the directions in the simulator. 

2. **Select via. Map** - The user will also have the option of selecting stores via a map instead of a list. This is easier for people who are more visual. 

3. **Select With Nod** - To make the simulation more immersive, the user will be able to browse through each store in the simulator and if they want to add it to the queue, then they can nod. 

4. **Find Washrooms and Playplaces** - On the map or list directory, the user will be able to toggle on and off options which allows them to see where the washrooms, foodcourts and playplaces are. 

5. **Check Out Food Before Buying** - As a foodie, I like to see images of the food before I even consider ordering it. In the simulator, the user will be able to check out each food place in the food court and check out what they have before placing an order via the simulator. 

6. **Check Top Rated Stores** - The user will have an option to check out which stores have the highest rating. From there, they will be able to read reviews which can alter their decision on which stores to visit. 

7. **Do A Quiz** - By doing a quiz, the user will be able to find stores that match the reason why they came to the mall in the first place. It could be a gift or shopping for clothes. After doing the quiz, the user will be recommended some stores! 

8. **Encouragement** - As the user approaches their destination, they will receive nice messages to help them finish it off, but if they go the wrong way, then they will receive helpful messages to get them back on track! 

9. **Bombard User With Instructions** - This will draw out confusion from the user in the beginning to only make them realize how easy it is and that they got this. 

10. **Play Music Based On Progress** - As the user starts out, then will have confusing music, but as they get closer to their destination, the music will become more happy!

1. **Nod To Understand** - In the beginning, the user will have to nod to show that they understand the instructions. 

2. **Select From Catalogue** - The user will be able to select furniture they want to build from a catalogue. 

3. **Confusion Strikes** - In the beginning, when the user browses through the instructions, they will get confused as the instructions are vague. 

4. **Lay Out Materials** - When the user is going to build the furniture, the materials are going to be laid out on the floor for the user to see. These will be clickable. 

5. **Instructions On The Side** - Instructions will be offered on the side to help the user out. The instructions can be accessed via clicking on a button. 

6. **Can't Give Up** - The user will not be able to 'quit' unless they finish the furniture. If they click the quit button, then they will receive words of encouragement. 

7. **Furniture Has Been Built!** - When the user is done building the piece of furniture, then a fanfare will be played! Woo! 

8. **Ending Message** - A message will be displayed which marks the end of the build session! Now they will have to replicate it in real life! 

9. **Pop Sound** - There will be a 'pop' sound when the user builds a part of the furniture to allow them that a new piece of furniture has popped up! 

After going over each variation, I decided to go with the IKEA Furniture Simulator because I felt that it would be the most practical out of each. Additionally, considering my time constraints along with other courses, this would be the best option for me. If I had more time, I would have liked to do the Party Simulator.

#### The IKEA Furniture Simulator
##### About
This simulator was the one that I managed to choose out of the remaining three choices. The reason why I decided to with this idea is because it relates to me a lot and I feel like many other people can relate as well. Furthermore, I brought a paper demo to the critique and I realized that I would really like to pursue this idea. Additionally, I felt that it would be fun to build this, kind of like a parody of IKEA instructions as well.

Three things that I really like about the simulator: 
###### 1. Music based on the situation
The Animal Crossing music is a nice fit to the simulator! It adds a soothing calmness versus the Illuminati song that plays during the overwhelming instructions situation. It took me some time to find the right music, but it was worth it! 
###### 2. Instruction Layout
I like how the instructions are literally right in front of you as you build the furniture. You can also click on the images of the instructions to bring up a model of what it should look like after the step has been done. I think this is very helpful to see if you're on the right track or not. 
###### 3. Selection and Highlighting of the Parts
I feel like adding a highlight on the part when the mouse is on top of it is an important aspect. Although it's something small, it's extremely useful to see which part the reticle is over. Additionally, the same can be said about selecting an item. The reticle opens wide and the part turns red when selected. It also does a pop sound which adds a nice touch as well! I also made pretty much all of the sounds except for the music :) ! 
###### If I had more time...
- Add more items to the catalogue as I found it hard enough with one piece of furniture.

##### Creating My Project
I'm going to be honest, but I literally started on Friday, Nov 3 and did most of it by Monday, Nov 6. I didn't leave my house for 3 days as I worked on this for around 12-13 hours a day. 

From there, I was extremely thankful that we got an extension so I could polish this up some more! 
I learned many things like using Audacity for editing recorded sound effects and little things such as changing the part's colour when selected can help make the interface easier to use. Additionally, I learned how to create parts using Blender as I created all of the table parts on there. Furthermore, I made the thought bubbles on Adobe Photoshop!

This project was fun to do, but it was tough going from not knowing any Unity to having to know Unity for this assignment. A lot of time was spent on trying to do simple things. I spent hours on troubleshooting the Raycast stuff when it already was working. For some reason, you need to tap directly on the object on the phone while you can click anywhere on the desktop program. 

The thing I really enjoyed was recording the sounds and editing them on Audacity. I also enjoyed creating the parts on Blender. Seeing these small things being added to the project made a huge difference. Also editing the IKEA instruction sheets to help suit the simulator was extremely important because they need to be altered in order to help the user. 

I really wanted the user to enjoy building furniture and head into it thinking that it's not that bad. I included instructions in the beginning to let the user know what to use throughout the simulator to navigate. In addition, I included the confusion scene because I wanted the user to experience confusion at first hand before heading into the building session. It could be more polished, but for the class presentation, I'm content to have something worthwhile to show.
