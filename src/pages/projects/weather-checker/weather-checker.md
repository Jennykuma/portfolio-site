#### Challenge
I wanted to challenge myself to brush up on my Node.js skills. The reason why I wanted to brush up on my skills is that I have been doing so much front-end that I was worried that I would slowly lose my knowledge in Node. Hence, this project was born! <p>
I chose to work with weather information because the API (OpenWeatherMap) is extremely accessible. I also thought that some people would maybe want to use it because it would also help give some suggestions on what to wear depending on the weather.

#### Weather Checker
##### About
I wanted it to be very simple and easy to use since my goal was to just simply notify the user about the temperature, humidity and receive a suggestion on what they should wear. For coding this small project, I had some guidance from this article on <a target="_blank" href="https://codeburst.io/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-node-js-in-just-16-lines-of-code-32261690901d">codeburst.io</a>. This helped me brush up on working with APIs. <p>
The user can enter in their city in two ways:
1. Using the city name - ex: Boston
2. Using both the city name and country code (2 characters) - ex: Boston, US

Once they type in their city, then temperature information will be obtained and presented to the user, along with a clothing suggestion. 

##### Presentation
Without adding too many distractions, I wanted an aesthetically pleasing web application.
- I used the image <i>Small Memory</i> from <a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/MikaelGustafsson">Mikael Gustafsson</a> as the background image to encourage others to go out on an adventure
- Got star resources from a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.script-tutorials.com/night-sky-with-twinkling-stars/">tutorial</a>
- Used <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">particles.js</a> to add a certain mysterious mood to the application's aesthetic through floating bubbles moving around the screen. 

With all of these resources combined, I felt that it gave my web application a kind of warm but mysterious and serene ambiance. Something along the lines of a kind of atmosphere where it would make the user want to travel to other places and type in those places to feel the temperature and humidity.

#### Suggestions for the Future
1. Add location grabbing <br/>
Instead of having the user type in the city they're in, I want to add a way to grab their location (by having permission first) and returning the temperature information automatically. <br/>
2. Add more features (like a to-do list) <br/>
If I can add some more features that are relevant to a user's day-to-day life, then this could possibly turn into a homepage that the user would visit everytime they open the browser. <br/>
3. Make the particles change depending on the temperature <br/>
Instead of reading a temperature off of the screen, I think that it would be pretty cool to make the animation particles change to snow or sunbeams depending on the temperature received from the API. This would add a more visual effect for the user.
